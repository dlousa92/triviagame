I used HTML, CSS and Javascript to build this cool little trivia game that will test your basic knowledge about code and web design.

I began the project by setting out a bronze, silver, and gold plan of the deliverables I could include in the game.
The bronze version was a very basic quiz that would let you know if you got the answer right, and that was about it
The silver version included some cool animations and would highlight the answers you gave either green or red depending on if
you answered correctly. It also included a score board that would follow you anywhere on the page
The gold version included a bonus secret question that shows off a little funky Javascript use and a game over screen whose contents
would depend on how well you did in the game.

I started building the project by laying out the HTML and positioning all my elements using Flexbox.
I like flexbox as it allows for smooth flow in styling and clean code.

You dont need to do anything special to play, just visit the site and start the quiz!
Good luck, and remember Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right, B, A, Start.
